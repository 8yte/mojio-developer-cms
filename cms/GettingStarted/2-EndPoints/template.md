[Purpose: More Technical overview of the APIs]

You as a developer can connect to the Mojio Platform through our APIS. You can use our REST and PUSH APIs to build your very own connect car apps, we at Mojio use the very same APIs to build our own apps.

### API Endpoints ###

The Mojio REST and PUSH APIs are supported for testing and live data in a single production environment and are connected to using OAuth2. There are two versions of the APIs, v1 and v2. We recommend using v2 it has most of the same features as v1 plus a bunch of cool new functionality that will make your apps even better! We'll only talk about Version two from here on out check out more [developer.moj.io](https://developer.moj.io) for more information on version 1. Version two is further divided into the REST API and PUSH API. 

	REST Base URI for Version 2: https://api.moj.io/v2/

The Push API for is for subscribing to live events. This can be used  to create observers for vehicles, users and Mojios that send notifications when certain changes occur.

    Push Base URI for Version 2: https://push.moj.io/v2/

A complete endpoint is formed by combining the REST verb with the full URI to the resource you are addressing.

To create a complete request, combine the endpoint with the appropriate HTTP headers and your JSON payload. You can try out the REST api here: 
[https://api.moj.io/swagger/](https://api.moj.io)

And you can try out the Push API here: 
[https://push.moj.io/swagger/](https://push.moj.io/swagger/)

Many of the API calls require an authorization header to be included in the request see our [ Authorization section](#/content/cms.Getting_Started.Authorization) to find out more.



### Routing ###

The routing is:

	<HTTP method> <Base URL>/v<version number>/<controller>/<optional entity id>?param1=value1&param2=value2&...

The Mojio API supports true REST-based HTTP methods, i.e.: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

### Controllers ###

The current controllers for v2 are as follows:

	Apps - manage your apps
    Groups - manage your groups
    Mojios - manage your Mojio(s)
    Trips - retrieve and filter on trips youâ€™ve made
    Users - manage your account
    Vehicles - manage your vehicle(s)

The Push controllers are:

	Configs - update configurations for observers
    Mojios - register and manage your observers for Mojios
    Users - register and manage your observers for users
    Vehicles - register and manage your observers for vehicles

### Next steps ###
