### Creating an Application ###

To start using the API you are going to need to sign up for a Mojio account and create your very own Mojio application!

Browse to the [My Apps](#/myapps) page create a new application.

1. Fill in the application name and click create.
1. Click the edit icon on the left.
1. You can then add a description and a list of redirect URIs, which are used in OAuth Authorization.
1. After you've created the app copy you the Id. You'll need this for OAuth authorization as well!


### Next Steps ###
