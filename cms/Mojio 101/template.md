## What is Mojio? ##

Mojio is a platform for connecting people to their vehicle.....

## How does it work? ##

#### How do you Connect a Mojio to a Vehicle? ####
It's easy. Mojio plugs into a vehicle's OnBoard Diagnostic (OBD) port, which is located under the dash usually within 24 inches of the steering wheel on the driver's side. Mojio uses machine-to-machine (M2M) cellular data exchange to send and receive data to and from a vehicle in real time. That data is "translated" and fed to an app on a smartphone, providing information about the vehicle and its status. 

#### Where will Mojio be available? ####
Mojio works in most cars built after 1995 and will connect to select cellular networks as we roll out across the world. Currently, we are available in the US and Canada. For more information on when Mojio will be available in your country, please contact us at info@moj.io

#### How does Mojio Connect to the internet? ####

Mojio connects to the Internet through an always-on cellular connection inside the Mojio that is plugged into a vehicle. This allows for a seamless experience and is important because Mojio makes the car the device that is connected to the Internet directly (not a smartphone). Through this always-on connection, among other advantages, you know where a vehicle is at any moment.

## Why Mojio? ##

The Why is up to you! Mojio believes that we can make vehicles more intelligent so that consumers can have better more personal relationships with their cars. Mojio keeps users connected to their favorite people, places and things.

Connect with the diagnostics of a vehicle to keep it maintained, track driving habits to predict future behavior and make life easier, keep track of gas consumption to save money and help the environment, or monitor for abnormal behavior to alert family and friends when there is an emergency, the possibilities are endless!
