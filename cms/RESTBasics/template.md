# REST API Basics#

The [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API can be used to create, read, update and delete resources. 

You can play with the API in the [REST API](/#/rest-list/REST/Apps) section.

### Authentication ###
The MojioAPIToken header must be included in all calls to the REST API. See the [Authorization section](#/content/cms.Getting_Started.Authorization) for more information on how to retrieve the Token.
