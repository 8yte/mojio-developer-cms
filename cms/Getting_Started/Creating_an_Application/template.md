### Creating your first Application ###

To start using the API you are going to need to sign up for a Mojio account and create your very own Mojio application!

Browse to our [developer center](https://developer.moj.io/account/signin) and sign up for new Mojio account if you haven't already.

    1. After you've signed in navigate to “My Account” -> “My Apps” and select “Create New App”

    2. Give your new App a name and a description, and click "Save App".

    3. You will be taken to your Apps page. Click the "plus" symbol to show the app details.

    4. Copy your App ID.

    5. From here you can click on “Manage” to edit your application, including add a redirect url which is used in OAuth authentication.

For more information on OAuth check out our [Authorization documentation](../Authorization/template.md).
