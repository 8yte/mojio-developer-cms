# REST API Basics#

The REST API can be used to create, read, update and delete resources. 

You can play with the REST API at [https://api.moj.io/swagger](https://api.moj.io/swagger).

### Authentication ###
The MojioAPIToken header must be included in all calls to the REST API. See the Authorization section [LINK] for more information on how to retrieve the Token.
