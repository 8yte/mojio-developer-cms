# Getting Started #

Welcome to Mojio! This page will help get you on your way to connecting to the Mojio Connected Device Platform.

The Mojio Connected Device Platform is the leading open platform for securely accessing and interacting with connected devices. Using a telematic control unit (TCU) connected to an asset, the platform retrieves, parses, and delivers a valuable array of telemetry data and information to the Mojio Motion app on a userâ€™s mobile device or approved third-party app. 

Mojio officially supports _iOS_, _Android_, _.Net_ and _JavaScript_ and has SDKs for each of these environments. If you do not use one of these environments, as long as your choice of development tools support open technologies such as _HTTPS_, _REST_ and _WebSockets_, you will be able to integrate with Mojio.

# Some Basic Ground Rules #

Mojio gives you access to a great deal of data from its connected devices. Our hope is that you will create apps and services to improve the experience of your users. We ask that you respect the user, their overall app experience, and safeguard their privacy.

As well, for developers creating integrations with our connected car devices, please note that driving while distracted is now a leading cause of accidents. Please keep this in mind with any solution you are developing and ensure that you do not distract the user when their focus should be on the road.

Finally, we want to help you build great apps. If there is anything we can do to make it easier to build connected device apps, please reach out to the Mojio team.
