# Simulator #

You can't always hop in your car and drive around whenever you want to test your applications, so we have a vehicle simulator to do the hard work for you. Even if you don't have a Mojio you can easily test out your application. 

We have two different simulators for you to work with. Use the basic Simulator for now. We have an alpha version of a multi-vehicle simulator which you can use if you are feeling adventurous.

You do not have to do anything special to access this test data it will come up right along with any real life data that you have.
